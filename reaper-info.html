  <h1>How Reaper Works</h1>
  <p>
    Reaper is built to give you more control over locked-down Windows environments.
    It bypasses certain restrictions by using a combination of kernel-level hooks,
    system command execution, and network-level packet management.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Main Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Network Manager</strong> – Scan, monitor, and manipulate network connections in real time.</li>
      <li><strong>Process Control</strong> – End or prioritize tasks even when Task Manager is disabled.</li>
      <li><strong>Command Line Access</strong> – Built-in terminal with extended admin privileges.</li>
      <li><strong>Windows Bypass Tools</strong> – Remove certain system-level restrictions without restarting.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h2>Stress Test Explanation</h2>

    <p>
      This section explains the <strong>website stress/load test</strong> concept used by the Baseline / Spike / Soak / Stress modes.
      The goal of a load test is to measure how a web service behaves under different traffic patterns so you can find bottlenecks and improve stability.
    </p>

    <h3>What the test measures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Latency</strong> — how long the site takes to respond (ms).</li>
      <li><strong>Success rate</strong> — percentage of successful (2xx–3xx) responses vs errors.</li>
      <li><strong>Throughput</strong> — requests per second the server can handle.</li>
      <li><strong>Stability over time</strong> — whether the server slows down or degrades under sustained load.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Modes — simple explanations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Baseline</strong> — steady, controlled traffic. Used to measure normal behavior and establish a baseline latency and success rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Spike</strong> — sudden burst of traffic early in the test. Used to see how the site behaves under quick surges (e.g., a viral moment).</li>
      <li><strong>Soak</strong> — lower-to-moderate traffic sustained for a long period. Used to detect memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or gradual performance degradation.</li>
      <li><strong>Stress</strong> — push to high or maximum concurrency to identify the system's breaking point and failure modes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How it works (conceptual)</h3>
    <p>
      At a high level the test:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Chooses a traffic pattern based on the selected mode.</li>
      <li>Starts multiple simultaneous requests (concurrency) to the target URL according to that pattern.</li>
      <li>Measures response time and response code for each request and records results to a log or CSV file.</li>
      <li>Monitors error rate; if too many failures occur, the test can stop early to avoid unnecessary load.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example (non-actionable, conceptual code)</h3>
    <p class="note">This is illustrative pseudocode showing the idea — it is <em>not</em> runnable load-test code and avoids implementation details.</p>
    <pre><code>// PSEUDO-CODE (concept only)
mode = "spike"                // baseline | spike | soak | stress
durationSeconds = 60
maxConcurrency = 200

pattern = ChoosePattern(mode, maxConcurrency, durationSeconds)

// For each scheduled attempt we:
sendRequest(targetUrl)        // perform a single HTTP request (measure latency and status)
record(timestamp, latencyMs, statusCode)

// At the end: analyze records to compute average latency, error rate, and throughput
</code></pre>

    <h3>Example of recorded CSV line</h3>
    <pre><code>1697040000000,124,200
// timestamp_ms, latency_ms, http_status_code
</code></pre>

    <h3 class="warning">Legal & safe use</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Running load or stress tests against servers you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test is unethical and may be illegal. Always:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Obtain written permission from the site owner or hosting provider before testing.</li>
      <li>Run tests in a controlled environment or on staging systems whenever possible.</li>
      <li>Set limits and error thresholds so tests stop automatically if the target starts failing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security & Usage</h2>
    <p> 
      Reaper should be used responsibly. While it offers advanced control, misuse can violate
      workplace, school, or government IT policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Admin Usage on Locked Devices</h2>
    <p>
      Reaper can gain elevated privileges on certain unpatched Windows systems by using a known 
      security flaw identified as <strong>CVE-2024-7479</strong>. This vulnerability affects 
      the way a popular remote desktop service handles local communications and driver loading.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the method involves interacting with a legitimate service running on the system, 
      performing a secure handshake to prove access, and then loading a trusted (but vulnerable) 
      driver to execute commands with full SYSTEM privileges. 
      Reaper uses this only to elevate your permissions locally — it does not connect to 
      any remote servers, install hidden software, or exfiltrate your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process will <strong>only work</strong> if your IT department has not pushed the 
      Windows or application update that fixes CVE-2024-7479. If the patch has been installed, 
      the privilege escalation will no longer function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once successful, Reaper can run administrative commands, change restricted settings, 
      and unlock features normally blocked on locked-down devices — but it will never 
      install backdoors, remote access tools, or hidden monitoring software. All actions 
      happen locally and only while the program is running.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Use this only on systems you own or have permission to manage. 
      Unauthorized use may violate laws or organizational policies.
