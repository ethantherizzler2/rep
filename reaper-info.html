  <h1>How Reaper Works</h1>
  <p>
    Reaper is built to give you more control over locked-down Windows environments.
    It bypasses certain restrictions by using a combination of kernel-level hooks,
    system command execution, and network-level packet management.
  </p>
  <h2>Main Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Network Manager</strong> – Scan, monitor, and manipulate network connections in real time.</li>
    <li><strong>Process Control</strong> – End or prioritize tasks even when Task Manager is disabled.</li>
    <li><strong>Command Line Access</strong> – Built-in terminal with extended admin privileges.</li>
    <li><strong>Windows Bypass Tools</strong> – Remove certain system-level restrictions without restarting.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Security & Usage</h2>
  <p> 
    Reaper should be used responsibly. While it offers advanced control, misuse can violate
    workplace, school, or government IT policies.
  </p>
<h2>Admin Usage on Locked Devices</h2>
<p>
  Reaper can gain elevated privileges on certain unpatched Windows systems by using a known 
  security flaw identified as <strong>CVE-2024-7479</strong>. This vulnerability affects 
  the way a popular remote desktop service handles local communications and driver loading.
</p>
<p>
  In short, the method involves interacting with a legitimate service running on the system, 
  performing a secure handshake to prove access, and then loading a trusted (but vulnerable) 
  driver to execute commands with full SYSTEM privileges. 
  Reaper uses this only to elevate your permissions locally — it does not connect to 
  any remote servers, install hidden software, or exfiltrate your data.
</p>
<p>
  This process will <strong>only work</strong> if your IT department has not pushed the 
  Windows or application update that fixes CVE-2024-7479. If the patch has been installed, 
  the privilege escalation will no longer function.
</p>
<p>
  Once successful, Reaper can run administrative commands, change restricted settings, 
  and unlock features normally blocked on locked-down devices — but it will never 
  install backdoors, remote access tools, or hidden monitoring software. All actions 
  happen locally and only while the program is running.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Use this only on systems you own or have permission to manage. 
  Unauthorized use may violate laws or organizational policies.
